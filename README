sslScanner is an open source Perl application which connects to a range of
hosts/ports which are running SSL based services such as HTTPS. It then displays
the certificate CN and how long is left until the certificate expires. Example:

mike@haven:~$ sslScanner --timeout 5 --expires-within 400 smtp.googlemail.com:465 haven.grepular.com 158.125.1.208/32
     IP Address   Port  Days Left  Common Name
   74.125.77.16    465        140  smtp.googlemail.com
  92.48.122.147    443        246  secure.grepular.com
  158.125.1.208    443        358  www.lboro.ac.uk
mike@haven:~$

If you want to be alerted when your certificate has less than 7 days left before
expiry, you might create a simple cron job like this:

@daily sslScanner --expires-within 7 example.com:443

Here are the usage details:

Usage:

1.) sslScanner <Options> <Hosts>
2.) cat Hosts_List.txt | sslScanner <Options>

Hosts:
  Any number of hosts can be scanned. They must each adhere to one of
  the following formats:

  x.x.x.x           : IP address
  x.x.x.x/cidr      : CIDR network. Requires Net::Netmask
  x.x.x.x:port      : IP address with port
  x.x.x.x/cidr:port : CIDR network and port. Requires Net::Netmask
  example.com       : Domain name
  example.com:port  : Domain name with port

  The port defaults to 443 (https) if not provided

Options:
  --help or -h          : Display this help information and exit
  --timeout secs        : Connection timeout. Default is 10
  --expires-within days : Only display info for those certs which
                          expire within x days, or that fail to lookup
